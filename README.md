# üìΩÔ∏è Movies App

This application might be my first real project in ReactJS. The app is called MoviesPlus+ and, with it, I learned how to include various functions and events using common React hooks like useState and useEffect.

The app offers some useful actions for modifying and searching movies:

- Firstly, if it's your first time visiting the website, an AJAX request will be sent, and the most trending movies will appear in the list.
- Then, those movies will be saved in Local Storage.
- In the sidebar, you can search for movies by typing the title into the input field.
- Also, in the sidebar, you can add any movie by simply entering the title and description (the ID will be generated automatically).
- On the movie cards, you can edit each movie by changing the title and description in a form that will appear.
- The last feature is the delete button, which removes the movie from the list.
- If you delete all the movies, an "error message" will be displayed, stating that if you reload the page, the default list will be restored.

## üìñ‚ÄäWhat I've Learned?
With MoviesPlus+, I've learned the most important and basic knowledge of this JavaScript framework called React. I've learned about the useState and useEffect hooks, how to create a React app, how to execute it, install dependencies, and also how to import and export different functions to send data between them. Maybe it's not the best project, but I'm confident that the next one will be even better than MoviesPlus+.
